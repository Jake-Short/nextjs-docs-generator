# Styling

There are a few options to choose from when styling the site. Read below about the possibilities.

## Themes

When running the site via `yarn dev`, the `styling-theming` page will have a themes section, where you can choose from one of the pre-built themes.

> A theme works by changing the variables in the `styles/variables.css` file to those of a pre-built theme.

## CSS Variables

Many aspects of the site, such as accent color, root font size, background color, and more can be altered inside of the `styles/variables.css` file. This file contains CSS variables, along with a description for all of the variables.

## Altering the CSS

In addition to altering the CSS variables, you can also edit the CSS directly. You can change any of the files inside of the `styles` folder to suit your needs.
