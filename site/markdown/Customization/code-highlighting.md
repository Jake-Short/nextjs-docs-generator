# Code highlighting

You can change the code highlighting theme by changing the imported theme inside the `components/codeblock.js` file.\
\
Change the `xcode` portion of this line to one of the other available themes:
```
import codeTheme from 'react-syntax-highlighter/dist/cjs/styles/hljs/xcode';
```
You can view a preview of possible themes [here](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/).
