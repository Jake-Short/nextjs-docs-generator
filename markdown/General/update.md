# Update

You are able to update your project to include new changes in the GitHub repository. To get started, run `yarn update`.\
\
After running that command, you will be asked to select which of the following folders you want to update:
`internal, styles, pages, components`.\
\
After choosing the folders to update, and confirming your actions, the remote GitHub repository will be downloaded and the new folders (as selected above) will overwrite the old ones.

>! Be careful which folders you choose to update! All files will be overwritten with the new ones.
